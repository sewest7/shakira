  <p>Shakira Isabel Mebarak Ripoll (/ʃəˈkɪərə/ shə-KEER-ə, Spanish: [(t)ʃaˈkiɾa]; born 2 February 1977),[4] known mononymously as Shakira, is a Colombian singer and songwriter.[5] Born and raised in Barranquilla, Shakira has been referred to as the "Queen of Latin Music"[6][7] and is noted for her versatility in music.[8][9][10] She made her recording debut under Sony Music Colombia at the age of 13. Following the commercial failure of her first two albums, Magia (1991) and Peligro (1993), she rose to prominence in Hispanic countries with her next albums, Pies Descalzos (1995) and Dónde Están los Ladrones? (1998). Shakira entered the English-language market with her fifth album, Laundry Service (2001), which sold over 13 million copies worldwide.</p>

    Buoyed by the international number-one singles "Whenever, Wherever" and "Underneath Your Clothes", the album propelled her reputation as a leading crossover artist. Broadcast Music, Inc., the largest music rights organization in the United States, described Shakira as a pioneer who extended the global reach of Latino singers.[11] Shakira is the highest-selling Colombian artist of all time, having sold between 50 and 60 million records.

    She has released countless albums and was the first musical act to perform three times at the FIFA World Cup, but to this day, Shakira still fascinates many of us. We bring you interesting facts about the star that you might have not known.</p>

Meanwhile, her English albums Oral Fixation, Vol. 2 (2005), She Wolf (2009) and Shakira (2014) were all certified gold, platinum, or multi-platinum in various countries worldwide. Some of her songs have charted at number one in multiple countries, including "La Tortura", "Hips Don't Lie", "Beautiful Liar", "Waka Waka (This Time for Africa)", "Loca", and "Chantaje".</p>
