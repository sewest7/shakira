  <p>Shakira Isabel Mebarak Ripoll (/ʃəˈkɪərə/ shə-KEER-ə, Spanish: [(t)ʃaˈkiɾa]; born 2 February 1977),[4] known mononymously as Shakira, is a Colombian singer and songwriter.[5] Born and raised in Barranquilla, Shakira has been referred to as the "Queen of Latin Music"[6][7] and is noted for her versatility in music.[8][9][10] She made her recording debut under Sony Music Colombia at the age of 13. Following the commercial failure of her first two albums, Magia (1991) and Peligro (1993), she rose to prominence in Hispanic countries with her next albums, Pies Descalzos (1995) and Dónde Están los Ladrones? (1998). Shakira entered the English-language market with her fifth album, Laundry Service (2001), which sold over 13 million copies worldwide.</p>
